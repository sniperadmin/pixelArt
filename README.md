## Instructions

I already built out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

Just open the index.html on your browser, choose the width and height for the grid system and submit!
Too easy! yeah?! now you can specify any color you want from the color picker and start clicking on each
cell to color it.

you can reset by submitting the form again with the dimensions you want!

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
